# Max AI Streaming Platform

## Overview
Max AI is an interactive AI-powered streaming platform featuring a 3D robotic rabbit character, "Max," that responds to user messages in real-time in English. The platform combines live streaming aesthetics with AI chat capabilities, powered by BNB Chain branding and blockchain technology. Users can interact with Max through a chat interface while viewing an animated 3D character display, creating an engaging live-streaming experience. The platform also displays the BNB Chain smart contract address with copy-to-clipboard functionality.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend uses React 18 with TypeScript, Vite for bundling, and Wouter for routing. UI components are built with Shadcn/ui, Radix UI primitives, and styled with Tailwind CSS, supporting dark/light modes with BNB Chain brand colors. The design system features a high-contrast theme (white backgrounds, dark text) with vibrant accents for emphasis, using Inter, Space Grotesk, and JetBrains Mono fonts. State management utilizes a WebSocket hook for real-time communication, React hooks for local state, React Query for API data, and WalletContext for global BNB wallet authentication. The 3D visualization (Max3DViewer) is a pure Three.js implementation with progressive loading: the idle model loads first for instant UI availability, while remaining emotion models (talking, thinking, angry, celebrating) load asynchronously in the background. The renderer is optimized with high-performance mode and capped pixel ratio for efficient rendering.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is an Express.js server handling HTTP requests and WebSocket connections for real-time chat. It supports dual AI providers (OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and Anthropic Claude Haiku) with a fallback mechanism, characterized by Max's friendly robotic rabbit personality with blockchain knowledge. An emotion-based response system uses sentiment analysis to detect emotional tones, triggering corresponding animations. Data persistence uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (via Neon) and Zod for schema validation. Real-time communication orchestrates client connections, user messages, AI responses, emotion state updates, and live viewer count tracking.

### Feature Specifications
- **BNB Wallet Authentication**: Users must connect a BNB Chain wallet to send messages, integrating with MetaMask/Web3 wallets. WalletContext manages global authentication state with secure validation and event listeners.
- **Live Viewer Counter**: The server tracks and broadcasts real-time active WebSocket connections to all clients.
- **Text-to-Speech Narration**: Max's responses are narrated using OpenAI TTS (model: tts-1, voice: "echo" - a friendly male voice suitable for Max's tender character). Audio is generated server-side, converted to base64, and auto-played in the browser. Animation syncs with audio duration using custom 'maxAudioEnded' event, maintaining 'talking' animation while speaking and returning to 'idle' when finished.
- **Rate Limiting**: 5-second cooldown per user between messages to prevent spam, with real-time feedback shown via toast notifications.
- **Contract Address Display**: Displays a BNB Chain smart contract address with copy-to-clipboard functionality and toast notifications.
- **Giggles Academy Integration**: Incorporates Max Rabbit stickers and Giggles Academy logos as decorative elements throughout the UI, with dynamic animations and text references.
- **High-Contrast Design**: Implements a clean, professional design with pure white backgrounds, dark gray foregrounds, and vibrant colors (BNB Chain yellow, blue, green, red) used sparingly for accents and active states. Dark mode inverts colors with dark backgrounds (9% lightness) and light text (92% lightness).
- **Language**: All application content, AI personality, and UI text are in English.
